# Fake-news-detector
In this digital age, information is our greatest weapon but it can also be made our greatest weakness by the means of fake news. Fake news on different platforms is a very big concern which is spreading at rapid rate as it causes social wars and series of misinformation spreading which can cause people to turn against each other. So we need a way to classify fake news so i made a fake news detector in Python using machine learning, I worked with importing lib like panda-importing dataset,matplotlib and seaborn-visualization, nltk for tokenizing the words and sklearn for testing and training.
